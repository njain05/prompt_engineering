# 📘 Day 15

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Introduction to Langflow
- Visual Interface for LLM Workflows
- Building Agents with Drag-and-Drop
- Integrating Tools and Memory
- Exporting and Deploying Workflows

## 🧠 Summary
Today was the perfect wrap-up to our week — we explored **Langflow**, a visual programming tool for building complex LLM workflows without writing heavy code. It’s like **Node-RED or Bubble**, but for **prompt engineering**.

We used Langflow to **design multi-step agents** using a drag-and-drop interface. Nodes represented prompts, tools, memory, and decision chains — giving us a visual overview of our entire AI logic.

What I loved most was the ability to quickly prototype ideas and connect functions together. It made debugging and iterating feel intuitive. Langflow bridges the gap between technical and creative thinking.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- Langflow interface and block structure
- Workflow design using visual nodes
- Linking memory, prompt chains, and tool use
- Exporting agents and deploying them via API

## 💻 Activity

| Task                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visual Agent Building       | Built a travel assistant that uses search + summarization   |
| Memory Integration          | Connected memory to remember user preferences               |
| Tool Composition            | Combined calculator, translator, and knowledge base tools   |

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
- Setting up Langflow locally (some installation bugs)
- Logic chaining needed careful ordering
- Remembering to assign input/output paths properly

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
**Langflow turns prompt engineering into an interactive design experience.**  
Perfect for visualizing, testing, and sharing LLM workflows.
