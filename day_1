# 📘 Day 01: 23rd June 2025

## ✅ Topic Covered
Introduction to Prompt Engineering and Generative AI

## 🧠 Summary
Even though today was our first real class session, it officially marks the start of our Prompt Engineering journey. We began with an introduction
to what Prompt Engineering is, why it’s important, and how it connects with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT.

Our instructor explained how the field of prompt engineering is growing rapidly, and how it helps bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding.
We also discussed the real-world applications — like chatbots, automation tools, summarization, and even code generation.

It was both technical and philosophical — I really liked how we didn’t jump straight into Python or models but instead built a strong foundation around **why prompting matters**.

## 🧪 Prompt Examples

| Prompt Type       | Example Prompt                                       | Notes                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot         | "Tell me something about prompt engineering."        | Too generic, needs clarity             |
| Instruction-based | "Explain what prompt engineering is, its need, and applications in simple terms." | Much better — gives specific intent    |

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- Generative AI basics
- The need for prompt engineering
- Applications of prompting (content creation, automation, etc.)
- Difference between good and bad prompts
- Prompt types (Zero-shot, Instruction)

## 💻 Activity
- Watched intro slides on Generative AI
- Explored ChatGPT with trial prompts
- Compared outputs from vague vs. refined instructions

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
It's still a bit hard to predict how AI will respond — sometimes, even when my prompt *felt* clear, the result wasn’t great. 
I'm starting to see how much wording matters.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Prompting is not just asking — it's designing a conversation with purpose.
