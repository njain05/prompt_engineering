# ðŸ“˜ Day 6

## âœ… Topic Covered  
Explored Google AI Studio and its features

## ðŸ§  Summary  
Todayâ€™s session focused on **Google AI Studio**. We explored its interface, understood the **Build** and **Stream** modes, compared it with OpenAI tools, and tested its token safety, response flexibility, and grounding abilities.  
We also reviewed its connection with **Google Search**, limitations with different token settings (`open` vs `unsafe`), and explored its **fine-tuning options**.

I tried the **Build mode** myself and created a **Music with AI** app.  
There was also discussion about API keys, SDKs, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), multimodal models, and use-case-based design templates.

## ðŸ§ª Key Concepts Covered

| Feature/Term        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google AI Studio    | Platform for building GenAI apps using Googleâ€™s LLMs                        |
| Build Mode          | Drag-and-drop interface for app creation; ideal for prototyping             |
| Stream Mode         | Displays real-time step-wise interaction results                            |
| Token Safety        | `open` vs `unsafe` options affect how freely the model responds             |
| Grounding           | Enables linking outputs with verified sources like Google Search            |
| Fine-Tuning Option  | Ability to train models further using specific instructions and examples     |
| SDK/API             | Developer kits for integrating AI Studio into external workflows            |
| Multimodal Models   | Support for text, audio, image, and video understanding                     |
| RAG/Notebook LLM    | Retrieval-Augmented Generation and notebook-based model interaction         |

## ðŸ’» Activity
- Explored and compared features of Google AI Studio
- Tried both **Build** and **Stream** modes
- Built a **Music with AI** app using the Build interface
- Studied token safety options and grounding via Google Search
- Understood SDK integration and potential for fine-tuning

## ðŸ¤” Challenges Faced
- Linking to external sources sometimes breaks in Stream mode  
- Still unclear on the full limits of token settings and grounding

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway  
Google AI Studio is a powerful, beginner-friendly tool to prototype GenAI applications â€” especially useful when working with structured data and real-time interactions.
