## âœ… Topic Covered
Image Generation with GenAI, Metadata, File Types, and Hugging Face API

## ðŸ§  Summary
Todayâ€™s class was focused on **image generation** using Generative AI. We explored different **image file formats** and learned about **metadata** â€” like image size, resolution, pixel ratio, etc.

We also worked on a project where we built an **image generator** that takes input from the user and generates an image while also fetching and displaying its properties. The generated image was also **stored locally**.

Finally, we learned how to use the **Hugging Face API** for AI-based image generation and handling responses.

## ðŸ§ª Concepts & Tools Covered

| Topic               | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image Metadata      | Includes dimensions, pixel ratio, file type, size, etc.           |
| File Formats        | JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP â€” and their use cases                        |
| GenAI for Images    | Using AI models to generate visual content                        |
| Hugging Face API    | Platform to access AI models via API                              |
| Image Storage       | Saving image files locally                                        |
| Input Handling      | Accepting user input to generate dynamic images                   |

## ðŸ’» Activity
- Built an image generation tool with a user input box
- Displayed image metadata (size, ratio, type, etc.)
- Saved images to local storage
- Integrated Hugging Face API for image tasks

## ðŸ¤” Challenges Faced
Understanding how different image formats store metadata differently was a bit confusing. API authentication and response parsing also took some debugging.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway
Generative AI isn't limited to text â€” it can create, analyze, and manage images too, with the help of APIs and metadata tools.
