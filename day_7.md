# ðŸ“˜ Day 7

## âœ… Topic Covered  
Speech-to-Text (STT) Conversion using Generative AI

## ðŸ§  Summary  
In today's session, we focused on **Speech-to-Text** (STT) systems and how they integrate with GenAI.  
We learned how to capture audio input, convert it to text, and use that text for further processing like answering questions or summarizing.

We explored the tools, challenges in transcription accuracy, and model behavior when dealing with human-like speech.

## ðŸ§ª Key Concepts Covered

| Concept             | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STT (Speech to Text)| Converting spoken audio into written text                                 |
| Input Pipelines     | Capturing real-time microphone input using Python libraries               |
| Transcription Models| Whisper, OpenAI APIs, and other open-source/free alternatives             |
| Use Cases           | Voice assistants, search engines, live captioning, AI-driven Q&A           |

## ðŸ’» Activity
- Implemented a basic **Speech-to-Text** converter using Python
- Experimented with transcription of various voice inputs
- Connected text output to a GenAI model for answering queries

## ðŸ¤” Challenges Faced
- Handling background noise in voice input  
- Minor transcription errors especially with unclear pronunciation or fast speech

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway  
Speech-to-text bridges the gap between human conversation and machine understanding, unlocking powerful voice-driven AI applications.
