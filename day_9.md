# ðŸ“˜ Day 9

## âœ… Topic Covered  
Supervised Machine Learning, OpenAI Fine-Tuning, and Generative Code Workflows

## ðŸ§  Summary  
Todayâ€™s session was deeply technical and incredibly insightful.  
We learned how **Supervised Machine Learning** fits into the GenAI ecosystem and explored the complete **end-to-end pipeline** â€” from dataset preparation to fine-tuning and testing.

We applied **Prompt Engineering** specifically for **code generation, debugging, and optimization** using OpenAI.  
We also explored how to use **Googleâ€™s Generative AI API** for prompt completion, showcasing the versatility of LLMs in automation and developer tools.

## ðŸ§ª Key Concepts Covered

| Concept                       | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supervised Learning Workflow  | Using labeled data to fine-tune models for specific tasks                    |
| Prompt Engineering for Code   | Writing prompts that generate, correct, or optimize code                     |
| Code Debugging with Prompts   | Identifying and fixing bugs using AI-generated suggestions                   |
| Dataset Preparation           | Creating clean, structured datasets (train-test split, JSONL format, etc.)   |
| Fine-Tuning                   | Teaching a model domain-specific behavior using curated examples             |
| Google GenAI API              | API for running prompts and completions using Google's LLMs                  |

## ðŸ’» Activity
- Prepared a dataset for a code generation task  
- Created train-test split files and cleaned prompt-response pairs  
- Fine-tuned a model with OpenAIâ€™s workflow  
- Generated Python code using prompts  
- Optimized and debugged code snippets using GenAI  
- Tested Google's GenAI API for completion and comparison

## ðŸ¤” Challenges Faced
- Ensuring the dataset format was accepted by OpenAIâ€™s CLI  
- Debugging when model outputs were logically incorrect despite syntactic correctness  
- Understanding and documenting API behaviors

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway  
Fine-tuning transforms generic models into highly focused tools â€” and combining that with prompt design lets us automate real dev tasks.
