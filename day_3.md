## âœ… Topic Covered
Exploration of AI Playgrounds, Prompt Structure, and API Introduction

## ðŸ§  Summary
In todayâ€™s session, we explored the practical tools that allow us to test and experiment with prompts â€” specifically, the **OpenAI Playground** and **Google AI Studio**. These tools help us understand how different settings affect the model's responses.

We also covered the breakdown of prompts into different types like **system prompts** and **user prompts**, and learned how to structure them correctly.

A key concept introduced was the **temperature** parameter, which controls how creative or deterministic the modelâ€™s response will be.

Lastly, we touched on the basics of **APIs** â€” what they are and how AI services can be integrated using them.

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Concepts Covered

| Concept            | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI Playground  | A platform to test prompts with custom model settings           |
| Google AI Studio   | Googleâ€™s tool for interacting with AI models using prompts      |
| Tokens             | Smallest units (e.g., parts of words) used for processing text   |
| System Prompt      | Sets the behavior/tone of the AI model                          |
| User Prompt        | Direct query or instruction given to the model                  |
| Temperature        | Controls randomness (0 = strict, 1 = creative)                  |
| API                | Interface for connecting external tools or systems with AI      |

## ðŸ’» Activity
- Explored OpenAI and Google AI playgrounds
- Created and tested system + user prompts
- Adjusted temperature values and observed output changes
- Discussed the role and structure of APIs in modern applications

## ðŸ¤” Challenges Faced
Understanding how slight changes in temperature affect randomness took some experimenting. Also, the distinction between system and user prompts was subtle at first but became clearer through hands-on testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway
Prompt behavior can be controlled with structure and parameters â€” and playgrounds are ideal for safely experimenting with this.
